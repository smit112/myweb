            <h2>TITLE HEADING</h2>
            
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">That's how our year looks</div>
            <p>Let's start with asking how are you guys doing,</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            
            
            <p>I am aware of what's going on in the world, what has been impacting people in our day to day life, some civil unrest, pandemic, unemployment, and some social impact in life. After seeing your loved once in pain and the worse, also not meeting your friends and family not able to travel and feeling lonely because of this pandemic. But sorry i won't be talking about any of this stuff anymore, if you want to know about all this stuff, we have lot of mediums 
                for that providing you live feed regarding everything going on.</p>
            <p>Today am not here to teach you how to remain positive in such tough times nor I am here to tell you what you should have done or what you should be doing differently to treat life better. I am just going to talk about some positive 
                 stuff happening around my world, and hope that if you are not, you will be using the same soon.</p>
            <h2>First let's talk about some changes in unemployment numbers today</h2>
            <p>Today i saw a decrease in number of unemployment which is a slow but the gradual change. Now you might say that it's not enough, 
                but to be specific it's a start for world getting back on its foot. 
                In last four months we have just seen worse and that's what we are looking, all the stuff is 
                just focus on how to change. Sorry won't be providing specific numbers 
                because I don't want it to get compared.</p>
            <h2>People back on street</h2>
            <p>It's not same yet, where all the people are in large groups shopping and having fun, there is still no dine-in with the food restaurant same and full as we are used too. 
                People are still wearing mask and must follow the different norms which are different than what 
                we are used too. Bit it's a slow process where at least people are able to go back on streets 
                and at least do some of the activities like enjoying nature, riding a bike and run without 
                fear or may be a walk at beach. Pools are still closed because of health regulation but at 
                least we can eat an ice-cream and sit outside and get tan.</p>
            <p>And there is a lot more positive stuff that I have been looking out daily 
                I won't be giving the section, but talking about all,</p>
            <p>Talking about all the digital help we got because of all the 
                innovation and reforms that the companies and its employees, 
                created were so helpful to lot of us in many ways, like for some 
                it was a entertainment, for some they were able to attain their office meetings, 
                lectures and workouts. This is a huge thanks to internet, the communication which 
                helped an entire world with so much of benefiting. Not only the stuff like this but 
                because of tech industry today a lot of people were able to keep their jobs and 
                because of that today at least we are not sinking around in the water. </p>
            <p>Thanks to the government for acting responsibly and trying whatever they can to keep 
                e countries safe and by taking the healthcare people voice in consideration. I know 
                there have been some issues but if we think, government is made to think about, 
                relationship, business, economy, health and a lots of other factors and healthcare is 
                well focused just with health, so we don't know what made them took what decision so 
                let's just keep the intent of this blog positive today. </p>
